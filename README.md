# Chat-Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the Java Chat Application! This project showcases a simple and useful Java chat programme that uses JavaFX to create its user interface. The application demonstrates the fundamentals of socket programming for network interactions by enabling communication between a server and several clients. This application is a useful teaching tool for Java networking, graphical user interface development, and concurrent programming because of its user-friendly design and live updates. This project offers helpful insights, regardless of whether you're a developer looking for a basis for developing chat applications or a learner investigating these ideas.

## How to Use

To use the Java Chat Application, follow these simple steps:

1. **Run the Server:**
   - Open the server component of the application by running the `Server` class. This initializes the server to listen for incoming connections on the specified port.

2. **Launch the Clients:**
   - Execute the `Client` class to initiate the chat clients. The application allows multiple clients to connect to the server simultaneously.

3. **Start Chatting:**
   - Once the server and clients are running, you can start sending messages. Type your message in the designated text field and press "Send" to share it with other connected clients.

4. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Experience real-time updates as messages are sent and received. The graphical user interface provides a seamless chat environment, and timestamps accompany each message for clarity.

5. **Explore Additional Features:**
   - Dive into the codebase to explore and customize additional features. The modular structure allows for easy understanding and potential expansion of functionalities.
